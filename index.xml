      <description>The tools for generating custom serialization from the specification are written in Python. Make sure that you have the python YAML parser, PyYAML, installed.
INSTALL PYTHON YAML PARSER On ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install python-yaml  On non-ubuntu systems, install from:
http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML  </description>

      <title>Basic Rules</title>

      <description>Specification format A domain specification is written as a flat YAML list, where each signal and branch is a self-contained YAML list element.
The YAML list is a single file, called a vspec file.
A vspec can, in addition to a YAML list, also contain include directives.
An include directive refers to another vspec file that is to replace the directive, much like #include in C/C++. Please note that, from a YAML perspective, the include directive is just another comment.</description>

      <guid>https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/branches/</guid>
      <description>A branch entry describes a tree branch (or node) containing other branches and signals.
A branch entry example is given below:
- Trunk: type: branch aggregate: true description: All signals related to the rear trunk The following elements are defined:
  Body.Trunk
The list element name defines the dot-notated signal name to the signal. Please note that all parental branches included in the name must be defined as well.</description>

      <description>What is VSS? The Vehicle Signal Specification introduces a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals. It can be used as standard in automotive applications to communicate information around the vehicle, which is semantically well defined. It focuses on vehicle signals, in the sense of classical sensors and actuators with the raw data communicated over vehicle buses and data which is more commonly associated with the infotainment system alike.
A standardized vehicle data specification allows an industry actor to use a common naming space for communication and, ultimately, abstracts underlying vehicle implementation details.</description>

      <description>After installing the dependencies, as described in the requirements, you can simply run:
make  The results will be stored in vss_$VERSION.[xxx], where $VERSION is the contents of the VERSION file and xxx is the appropriate file extension for the type of output being produced. For example, the JSON version of the output will have a .json extension.
Changes to files under the spec/ directory results in changes to the generated files, namely .</description>

      <description>The figure below explains the idea of a taxonomy as bridge between human and machine understanding of data. It is important to focus on a specific domain to get common understanding and acceptance. The link between two or more domain taxonomies can be seen as second step.
Components of a domain taxonomy A domain taxonomy, like VSS, consists of three important components, which will be discussed in detail in this documentation:\</description>

      <title>Enumerated Sensors &amp; Actuators</title>

      <description>A data entry can optionally be enumerated, allowing it to be assigned a value from a specified set of values. An example of an enumerated sensor is given below:
- Chassis.Transmission.Gear: type: sensor datatype: uint16 enum: [ -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ] description: The selected gear. -1 is reverse. An enumerated signal entry has no min, max, or unit element.
The enum element is an array of values, all of which must be specified in the emum list.</description>

      <description>An attribute is a signal with a default value, specified by its value member.
The value set for an attribute by a vspec file can be read by a consumer without the need of having the value sent out by a publisher. The attribute, in effect, is configuration data that can be specified when the vspec file is installed.
Below is an example of a complete attribute describing engine power</description>

      <description>An include directive in a vspec file will read the file it refers to and the contents of that file will be inserted into the current buffer in place of the include directive. The included file will, in its turn, be scanned for include directives to be replaced, effectively forming a tree of included files.
See Fig 6 for an example of such a tree.

The include directive has the following format:</description>

      <description>The private branch offers a way to clearly separate OEM specific definitions and the specification. It helps adapting the specification to the needs of the organisation.
Extending and overriding Data Entries The core signal specification can be extended with additional signals through the use of private branches, as is shown in Fig 3.
Fig 3. Extended signals
In this case the core signal specification, vss_23.vspec is included by a OEM-specific master vspec file that adds the two proprietary signals Private.</description>
